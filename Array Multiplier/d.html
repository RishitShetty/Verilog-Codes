An array multiplier is a digital combinational circuit used for multiplying two binary numbers by employing an array of
full adders and half adders. This array is used for the nearly simultaneous addition of the various product terms involved. 
To form the various product terms, an array of AND gates is used before the Adder array.
Checking the bits of the multiplier one at a time and forming partial products is a 
sequential operation that requires a sequence of add and shift micro-operations. 
The multiplication of two binary numbers can be done with one micro-operation by means of a 
combinational circuit that forms the product bits all at once. This is a fast way of multiplying 
two numbers since all it takes is the time for the signals to propagate through the gates that form the multiplication array.
However, an array multiplier requires a large number of gates, and for this reason it was not economical until the development of integrated circuits.
