Shift-and-add multiplication is similar to the multiplication performed by paper and pencil. 
This method adds the multiplicand X to itself Y times, where Y denotes the multiplier. 
To multiply two numbers by paper and pencil, the algorithm is to
take the digits of the multiplier one at a time from right to left, 
multiplying the multiplicand by a single digit of the multiplier and placing the intermediate product in the
appropriate positions to the left of the earlier results.
